# 🏋️ Gym Workout Tracker CLI App

A simple yet powerful **Command-Line Interface (CLI) application** to help users track their workouts, including exercises, sets, reps, and workout dates.

Built using **Python** and **SQLAlchemy ORM**, this project demonstrates best practices in CLI design, database modeling, and modular Python packaging.

---

## 📌 Features

- Add new users
- Log workouts by date
- Record individual exercises with sets and reps
- View all workouts for any user
- SQLite-based local database (`gym.db`)
- Clean and interactive command-line interface

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- SQLite (for local storage)
- Pipenv (for virtual environment and dependency management)
